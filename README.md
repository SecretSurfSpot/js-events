![processFlowSquareNumber diagram](https://github.com/SecretSurfSpot/js-events/blob/master/images/processFlowSquareNumber.png)


### Instructions

- Clone this repo
- Open `index.html` in your browser and try out the top function - add a number into the text field and press the button next to it.
- examine the html and js files to understand what is happening here and how.  Try to follow the flow of information through the application from the point at which you click on the button, to the point at which the text appears on the page.
- Implement the next two functions - halving a number and finding a percentage.  Some of the necessary logic is already provided for you - your job is to set up some events so that the functions are properly implemented.
- Document your understanding of how JavaScript events work in the context of a single page app - try diagramming or making notes on one of the functions in this application.
